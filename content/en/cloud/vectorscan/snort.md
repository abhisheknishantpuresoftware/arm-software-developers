    Learn how to build Snort, an open source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and run it with Vectorscan on AWS EC2 instances powered by Arm64 achitecture.
---

## Pre-requisites

* An [Arm based instance](/cloud/platforms) from an appropriate cloud service provider.

This learning path has been verified on AWS EC2 and Oracle cloud services.

## Detailed Steps

[Snort3](https://www.snort.org/snort3) is a very popular open-source deep-packet inspection application. It has integrated Hyperscan, the regex parsing library.

[Vectorscan](https://github.com/VectorCamp/vectorscan) is an architecture-inclusive fork of [Hyperscan](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan), that preserves the support for x86 and modifies the framework to allow for Arm architectures and vector engine implementations.

In this article we will detail the steps to install Snort3 on an Ubuntu Linux Arm-based platform, and run it with Vectorscan.

### Install the pre-requisites for Snort

First, ensure you system is up to date with the latest packages:

```console
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```

Next, ensure your system has the correct time zone:
```console
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

Now, create a directory where you will download and install the tarballs for the packages `snort` requires
```console
mkdir ~/snort_src
cd ~/snort_src
```

Install the `Snort3` pre-requisites to this directory

```console
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential autotools-dev libdumbnet-dev libluajit-5.1-dev libpcap-dev \
zlib1g-dev pkg-config libhwloc-dev cmake liblzma-dev openssl libssl-dev cpputest libsqlite3-dev \
libtool uuid-dev git autoconf bison flex libcmocka-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev libunwind-dev \
libmnl-dev ethtool libjemalloc-dev
```

### Download and install [safec](https://rurban.github.io/safeclib/doc/safec-3.3/index.html) for runtime bound checks:

```console
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/rurban/safeclib/releases/download/v02092020/libsafec-02092020.tar.gz
tar -xzvf libsafec-02092020.tar.gz
cd libsafec-02092020.0-g6d921f
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Download and install [gperftools 2.9](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) performance analysis tools:

```console
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/releases/download/gperftools-2.9.1/gperftools-2.9.1.tar.gz
tar xzvf gperftools-2.9.1.tar.gz
cd gperftools-2.9.1
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Install `Ragel`:
```console
sudo apt install ragel
```

### Install `PCRE` to your `snort_src` folder:
```console
cd ~/snort_src/
wget wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/pcre/8.45/pcre-8.45.tar.gz
tar -xzvf pcre-8.45.tar.gz
cd pcre-8.45
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Download (but do not install) `Boost` C++ Libraries:
```console
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.77.0/source/boost_1_77_0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf boost_1_77_0.tar.gz
```

### Download `Vectorscan` source
```console
cd ~/snort_src
git clone https://github.com/VectorCamp/vectorscan 
cd vectorscan 
git checkout v5.3.2 
cd .. 
mkdir hyperscan-build 
cd hyperscan-build/ 
```

### Fix source to build with glibc>=2.34

There is a current issue where builds fail with `glibc >= 2.34` and a pending [PR](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan/issues/359).

For now, workaround this issue by making the changes to `STACK_SIZE` as mentioned in the [pull request](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan/pull/358/files/eac1e5e0354f3ead2c832e798d89f86082b77d75).

### Configure and build Vectorscan
```console
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DBOOST_ROOT=~/snort_src/boost_1_77_0/ ~/snort_src/vectorscan/
make && make install 
```
### Install flatbuffers
```console
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.0.tar.gz -O flatbuffers-v2.0.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf flatbuffers-v2.0.0.tar.gz
mkdir flatbuffers-build
cd flatbuffers-build
cmake ../flatbuffers-2.0.0
make
sudo make install
```

### Download and install Data Acquisition library(DAQ)

```console
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/snort3/libdaq/archive/refs/tags/v3.0.5.tar.gz -O libdaq-3.0.5.tar.gz
tar -xzvf libdaq-3.0.5.tar.gz
cd libdaq-3.0.5
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Update shared libraries
```console
sudo ldconfig
```

### Download, Compile and Install `Snort3` with the default settings
```console
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/snort3/snort3/archive/refs/tags/3.1.18.0.tar.gz -O snort3-3.1.18.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf snort3-3.1.18.0.tar.gz
cd snort3-3.1.18.0
./configure_cmake.sh --prefix=/usr/local --enable-tcmalloc --enable-jemalloc
cd build
make
sudo make install
```

### Check Snort3 is installed and running properly

`Snort3` should be installed in `/usr/local/bin`. Verify it is installed and running correctly by checking the version:

```console
/usr/local/bin/snort -V
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```

```

### Test Snort3 with Vectorscan

To test the performance of `Snort3` with `Vectorscan` on your Arm instance, first download a capture file to test with:
```console
mkdir ~/snort3_test
cd ~/snort3_test
wget https://download.netresec.com/pcap/maccdc-2012/maccdc2012_00001.pcap.gz
gunzip maccdc2012_00001.pcap.gz
```

Now run the following command to use `hyperscan` (i.e. `vectorscan`) with `snort3` on the downloaded capture file. It uses the default configuration file:
```console
snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua --lua 'search_engine.search_method="hyperscan"' -r maccdc2012_00001.pcap
```

You should see detailed output with packet and file statistics and a summary similar to the below.
```
