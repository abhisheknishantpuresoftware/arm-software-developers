    Learning path for software developers using compression libraries running on Arm servers.  
---

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Install and run lzbench with snappy and zstd
* Measure compression library performance running on 64-bit Arm AWS EC2 instance


## Pre-requisites

* An Amazon Web Services(AWS) account. 
* Some familiarity with launching and running EC2 instances in AWS is helpful but not necessary.
