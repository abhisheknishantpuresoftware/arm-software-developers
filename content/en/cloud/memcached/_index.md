    Learning path for software developers using memcached as their in-memory key-value store for mobile, web, gaming or e-Commerce applications running on Arm servers.  
---

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Install and run memcached on your 64-bit Arm AWS EC2 instance
* Use an open-sourced benchmark to test memcached performance on 64-bit Arm AWS EC2 instance


## Pre-requisites

* An Amazon Web Services(AWS) account. 
* Some familiarity with launching and running EC2 instances in AWS is helpful but not necessary.
