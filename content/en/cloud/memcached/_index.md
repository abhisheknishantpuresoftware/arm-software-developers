    Learning path for software developers using memcached as their in-memory key-value store for mobile, web, gaming or e-Commerce applications running on Arm servers.  
---

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Install and run memcached on your [Arm-based platform](/cloud/platforms)
* Use an open-sourced benchmark to test memcached performance on your instance


## Pre-requisites

* An [Arm based instance](/cloud/platforms) from an appropriate cloud service provider

This learning path has been verified on AWS EC2 and Oracle cloud services.
