## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Build x265 codec on Arm server
* Run x265 codec on Arm server with the same video of various resolutions and encoding presets to measure the performance impact

## Pre-requisites

* An [Arm based instance](/cloud/providers) from an appropriate cloud service provider running `Ubuntu 20.04.`
