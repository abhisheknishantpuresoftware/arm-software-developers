    Learning path for software developers using MongoDB as their database for mobile, IoT applications, content management or real-time analytics running on Arm servers.  
---

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Install and run MongoDB on your Arm-based instance
* Use an open-sourced java application to test MongoDB performance on 64-bit Arm-based instance
* Run Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark(YCSB) to measure and compare the performance of MongoDB on Arm versus other architectures.

## Pre-requisites

* An [Arm based instance](/cloud/providers) from an appropriate cloud service provider.

This learning path has been verified on AWS EC2 and Oracle cloud services.
